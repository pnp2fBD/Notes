Mutable Strings/ String Buffer 
Sting Buffer is a class where you can modify your strings

StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("JAVA")
sb.append("J2EE")
	
Create in non Constant Pool memory and modify the existing String 

String Buffer are Synchornized (Thread Safe).

String Builder - as similar as String Buffer but it is not sychronized

Only Difference - String Buffer is thread safe whereas String Builder is not

String        Diff   String Buffer
Immutable             mutable
Hashcode changes      HashCode remains same
Literal way 	     Object Way
Non-Sync- No need     Syncronized - by default 	

Serialization - Converting your object into byte stream
so that they can travel to next machine on network
i.e. also write into files as well through serialization

Object - is an identity which has some state and behaviour

Convert Object States --> Byte Stream

De-Serialization - Converting back the Byte Stream to Object

Interface - Serializable
Serializable implements marker interface - Its a empty interface
Serializable Interface - tells to JVM that this class has special feature that it can convert the object to bit and byte and can travel to n/w or write to files as well

make Salary field - Static or Transient (than it can not serialized)

Transient - special Access modifier/specifier - who will restrict the serialization for specific varibale 

IS-A relation (means inheritence) - Serialization works for child class

HAS-A Relation - reference object can not be serialized
reference class has to implement serialization by its own

Exteralization - is a  interface
its a process to convert objects to byte stream
has two methods WriteExternal & ReadExternal

Comparable interface - to sort the objects 
String class already implemented comparable interface

Comparator Interface (java.lang package) - if
