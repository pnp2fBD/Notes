If class needs to compare object than that class should need to have comparable mechanism

Comparable interface: Java.Lang (Package)
Class should define itself that it can compare with Id only
Limitation - You can provide natural sorting by one field only i.e. id or name (you can npt compare with multiple fields you have reconstruct the class)

Comparator Interface -  Java.Util (Package)
Example - idComparator

The comparable class will comes with default comparing mechanism
whereas in comparator class we need to explicity define the comparasion mechanism.

In comparable interface - way of comparsion is fixed.
In comparator - comparision mechanism keep on changing
