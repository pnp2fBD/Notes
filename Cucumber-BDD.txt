###Cucumber/BDD - Behaviour Driven Development

JUnit/TestNG - TDD framework

Gherkin - Write plain english language

Cucumber - JVM/Ruby  available with Java and Tuby

Jbehave - available with Java only

3 Main Components 

1. Feature file  - e.g.  Login.Feature  -> Keywords	- Feature, Given, When, Then, As, But ,*

2. Step Defination File  -> Selenium + Java + Annotation

3. Test runner  -> JUnit (to run our feature and to generate the output/report)


Advantage

1. Anyone can create Testcases in Feature file i.e. manual tester,manager or product

2. Write the Acceptance creatia in Feature file - entire agile team can contribute

3. later on develop and write the step defination file

Disaadvantage of BDD

- Lengthy process to write as we have to write behaviour

###Cucumber Options:

dryRun
Features
Glue
Monochrome
Format
Strict
Tags

All these cucumber options will be defined in TestRunner Class

1. Dry Run - if you want to check all steps are written in step defination or not  i.e. dryRun = true		

2. Features  - path of features file

3. glue - path of step definations files are available

4. monochrome = it will generate readbale output , display the oonsole output in proper format, Must use to generate readbale format.

5. Strict - if any step is not defined it will check fail the execution if some undefined steps are there

3### Data Driven Testing using Cucumber
1. Simple Data Driven - without example
2. With Examples + Scenario Outlines
3. using Tables


Difference - Scenario and Scenario Outlines
	Data drivern approach with Exampls -> Scenario Outlines
	Without example -> Scenario

	
System Outline-Example approach is better than datatable

# cucumber datatable
- Suppose you have multple data 
- then you have to modify your code

- System Outline - Example approach - it will be automatically reiterated with mutlipple set of data rows

 Systemoutline-Example  is better as it is applicable to whole test scenario

#Parametrization of Test Cases in cucumber :
1. Simple Scenario of Data Driven - without example
2. Scenario Outline - Example
3. DataTable
4. DataTable asMaps
